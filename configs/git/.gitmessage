# --------------------
# Remember to
#   - Capitalize the subject line
#   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   - Do not end the subject line with a period
#   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   - Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body.
# --------------------
# ** wip commit type
#   A wip commit should only happen on a local branch. These commits are for
#   unfinished snapshots that should not be checked into a shared branch.
#   These commits should be squashed before changes are merged to
#   a shared branch.
